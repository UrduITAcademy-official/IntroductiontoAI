# Basics of AI for Beginners

This course entails the basics of AI for non-technical and fresh learners. We will start from the basics of AI and machine learning, then familiarity with python and Google Colab. We will briefly discuss machine learning models for object classification and detection. Next, we will highlight AI applications for images and speech processing. Finally, the audience will be familiarized with some advanced deep learning libraries like pytorch or Tensorflow etc.
